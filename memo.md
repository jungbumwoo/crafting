### 10.2 Native Functions
Curiously, two names for these functions— “native” and “foreign”—are antonyms. Maybe it depends on the perspective of the person choosing the term. If you think of yourself as “living” within the runtime’s implementation (in our case, Java) then functions written in that are “native”. But if you have the mindset of a user of your language, then the runtime is implemented in some other “foreign” language.
